## 📋 Description

The Hotel Booking System is a comprehensive digital platform designed to streamline the process of reserving hotel accommodations. This system serves as a bridge between customers seeking lodging and hotels offering their rooms, automating what was traditionally a manual, time-consuming process.

### Core Purpose

The system enables customers to search for available rooms, view room details and pricing, make reservations for specific dates, and manage their bookings — all through an intuitive digital interface. For hotel administrators, it provides tools to manage room inventory, track occupancy, process payments, and maintain customer records efficiently.

### Key Components

- **Customer Management** — Handles guest information, including registration, profile management, and booking history. The system stores essential customer details such as name, contact information, and preferences to streamline future bookings.
- **Room Management** — Maintains a comprehensive database of available rooms with detailed specifications including room type, amenities, capacity, and pricing. The system automatically updates room availability status in real-time.
- **Booking Management** — Processes reservation requests, validates availability for requested dates, and manages the complete booking lifecycle from creation to cancellation or completion.
- **Payment Processing** — Calculates total charges based on room rates, number of nights, and any additional services. The system handles secure payment transactions and generates invoices for completed bookings.

### System Benefits

This system eliminates manual paperwork, reduces booking errors, provides 24/7 availability for customers to make reservations, and offers hotels better control over their inventory and revenue management. It creates a seamless experience for both guests and hotel staff by centralizing all reservation-related activities in one platform.
